# **Problem**
Many people I know have described their relationships to museums through the phrase, "I'm not really a museum person." When pressed, they often explain that it is not that they dislike the act of looking at art. Rather, they often find themselves a little bored at museums, intimidated by the knowledgable people surrounding them who can spend seemingly-unlimited amounts of time gazing at a single work\
  In 2014, journalist Philip Kennicott wrote an article in the Washington Post directed at this type of museum visitor entitled "How to view art: Be dead serious about it, but donâ€™t expect too much." He advises viewers to force themselves to spend lengthy amounts of time looking at art in complete silence and to study art before enterring the museum doors. But his advice seems like it would alienate those who feel intimidated by museums even further. A different strategy is needed to help people shed their prejudice against museums and reach the realization that looking at art is an activity anyone can enjoy.
