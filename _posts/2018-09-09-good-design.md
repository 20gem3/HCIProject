In his book, "The Design Of Everyday Things," Norman breaks good design into two crucial componants: "discoverability and understandability." For him, this means that well designed objects must clearly display both their range of possible actions and the procedure for performing these actions. I think my simple coffee machine perfectly embodies Norman's criteria. The coffee maker only has one switch with clear signifiers: "on" and "off" labels. To use the coffee machine, one must only flip the switch from the off position to the on position and the machine offers clear feedback: the switch lights up when it is in the on position. To make coffee, one must have a small amount of outside knowledge and equipment. One needs a coffee filter,  coffee and water. Though the machine itself does not explicitly reveal this, it only contains one spot that the coffee filter could be placed eliminating the possibility of confusion. Moreover, the inside of the place on the machine where the filter should be placed mimcs the ridges of the filter. Thus, the machine uses mirroring to make the mapping between the filter and the place where it goes on the machine clearer. The machine's only other oriface clearly must be used for water and is labeled with numbers to show how much water to pour in to make a specific numbers of cups. The pitcher that eventually holds the coffee is also labeled with numbers so one can fill the pitcher water from the sink, pour in the appropriate amount and then place that pitcher in the coffee machine to catch the coffee (maximizing efficiency.) Though it offers no clues as to how much coffee one should pour in, I forgive the machine for this ommission for this seems personal to each individual brewer (I quickly figured out that for my 4 cups of coffee I wanted two scoops of of coffee grounds). All in all, this extremely affordable object seems perfectly designed for a sleepy user who can roll out of bed, stumble into the kitchen and easily achieve their morning caffeine fix.
